Verilog code to use the on board ADC of the Artix 7 using AXI protocol and displaying the voltage level on the display

As of 12/19/20 this repo contains the xdc file for the Basys 3, code to utilized the onboard XADC to the Basys 3, a DDS (Direct Digital Synthesis) compiler which digitally generates a sinusoid, a finite state machine which parameterizes the phase increment and the total number of bits in the phase accumulator of the DDS and code from other Verilog designs temporarily put here that are not related to the PID project.
