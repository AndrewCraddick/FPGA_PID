# FPGA_PID
Verilog HDL code PID controller using FPGA Project

This is still in its infancy stages.

As of 12/19/20 this repo contains the xdc file for the Basys 3, code to utilized the onboard XADC to the Basys 3, a DDS (Direct Digital Synthesis) compiler which digitally generates a sinusoid, a finite state machine which parameterizes the phase increment and the total number of bits in the phase accumulator of the DDC and code from other Verilog designs temporarily put here that are not related to the PID project.
